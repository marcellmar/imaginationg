# ðŸš€ 5 Signals You're Drifting Instead of Moving

A quick diagnostic to spot momentum killers in your project, business, or team.

## 1. Meetings Multiply, Outcomes Disappear
If your calendar is full but your checklist is empty...
â†’ You're drifting.

## 2. You're Collecting Insights, Not Decisions
Endless reports, no clear next steps?
â†’ You're in data fog, not movement.

## 3. Everything Feels 'Almost Ready'... Forever
Perfection is the enemy of momentum.
â†’ You're polishing, not pushing.

## 4. Your Team Asks for Permission, Not Accountability
When people wait for directives instead of making moves...
â†’ You're managing, not mobilizing.

## 5. Your Energy is Scattered Across Too Many 'Nice to Haves'
Busyness â‰  progress.
â†’ You're stuck in noise, not clarity.

## âœ… IMAGINATION G's Rule of Thumb:
