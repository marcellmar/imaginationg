## AEO Readiness Improvement

**Before:** 2.5/10
**After Today:** ~5/10

Still needed for full AEO optimization:
- Sitemap.xml generation
- Answer pages creation (35 pages planned)
- Schema on all pages
- Complete AI tracking dashboard
- Static rendering optimization

## Next Steps (From Audit)

### This Week Tasks:
- [ ] Install & configure sitemap
- [ ] Create first answer pages
- [ ] Add schema to service pages
- [ ] Set up complete AI tracking

### This Month Tasks:
- [ ] Build 10 answer pages
- [ ] Implement full schema
- [ ] Create citation tracking
- [ ] Launch AI-specific campaigns

## Important Note

GA4 Measurement ID needs to be updated in `/pages/_app.tsx`:
```javascript
const GA_MEASUREMENT_ID = 'G-XXXXXXXXXX'; // TODO: Replace with your GA4 ID
```

## Summary

Today we transformed IMAGINATION G from invisible to AI engines (2.5/10) to accessible and partially optimized (5/10). The site now:
- Welcomes AI crawlers
- Provides structured data
- Tracks AI-driven traffic
- Answers specific user queries in meta descriptions

This positions IG to start receiving AI citations and tracking their impact on revenue.
