## üìä **EXAMPLE: MEETING REALITY TEST AUTOMATION**

### **IMAGINATION G Diagnostic Question:**
*"Do your meetings produce decisions or more meetings?"*

### **Old Way (Manual):**
**IMAGINATION G**: "Do your meetings produce decisions?"
**Client**: "Yes, our meetings are productive."
**Result**: Opinion vs. opinion, no proof

### **New Way (Workflow Plugin):**
**Workflow connects to calendar ‚Üí Automatically produces stats:**

## üí° **WHY THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY**

### **Traditional Consulting:**
- **McKinsey**: "Based on our interviews, your meetings seem inefficient"
- **Client**: "That's just your opinion"
- **Cost**: $500K for subjective assessment

### **IMAGINATION G Workflow Approach:**
- **IMAGINATION G**: "Your calendar shows 78% of meetings schedule follow-ups instead of making decisions"
- **Client**: "That's data from our own system... we can't argue with that"
- **Cost**: $2,500 for scientific assessment

### **The Difference:**
- **Opinion vs. Scientific proof**
- **Expensive vs. Affordable**  
- **Subjective vs. Measurable**
- **Questionable vs. Undeniable**
