# WORKFLOWS EXPLAINED FOR BEGINNERS

**A Simple Guide to Understanding Workflows and How They Transform IMAGINATION G**

---

## ü§î **WHAT IS A WORKFLOW?**

Think of a workflow like a **recipe for getting things done automatically**.

### **Real-World Example:**
Imagine you want to make coffee every morning. A "coffee workflow" would be:
1. Fill kettle with water
2. Turn on kettle
3. Grind coffee beans
4. Put coffee in filter
5. Pour hot water over coffee
6. Wait 4 minutes
7. Enjoy coffee

A **digital workflow** does the same thing, but with computer tasks instead of coffee tasks.

---

## üîß **WHAT ARE BUSINESS WORKFLOWS?**

Business workflows are **step-by-step instructions that computers follow to do business tasks automatically**.

### **Simple Example - Sending a Welcome Email:**
**Manual Way** (what humans do):
1. New customer signs up
2. Employee gets notification
3. Employee opens email program
4. Employee writes welcome email
5. Employee sends email
6. Employee updates customer record

**Workflow Way** (what computers do automatically):
1. New customer signs up ‚Üí **Computer automatically sends welcome email**
2. **Computer automatically updates customer record**
3. **Computer automatically adds customer to mailing list**

**Result**: What took 15 minutes of human time now happens in 2 seconds, automatically.

## üè¢ **HOW DO WORKFLOWS HELP IMAGINATION G?**

IMAGINATION G helps companies fix "organizational drift" - when companies get slow, confused, and ineffective. Workflows help us **prove and track this scientifically** instead of just guessing.

### **Before Workflows (Old Way):**
**IMAGINATION G Consultant**: "Your company seems slow at making decisions."
**Client**: "How do you know?"
**Consultant**: "I can tell from talking to people."
**Client**: "That's just your opinion..."

### **After Workflows (New Way):**
**IMAGINATION G System**: "Your company takes an average of 47 days to make decisions."
**Client**: "How do you know?"
**System**: "I tracked 156 decisions through your project management system. Here's the data."
**Client**: "Wow, that's scientific proof!"

---

## üìä **IMAGINATION G DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS + WORKFLOWS**

IMAGINATION G asks 12 questions to diagnose "organizational drift." Here's how workflows make each question **automatic and scientific**:

### **Question 1: "How long since your last major decision?"**
**Old Way**: Ask the CEO, get a guess
**Workflow Way**: Connect to the company's project management system, count actual decisions made
**Result**: "You made 3 decisions in the last 30 days, down from 12 the month before"

### **Question 2: "Do your meetings produce decisions or more meetings?"**
**Old Way**: Ask people their opinion
**Workflow Way**: Connect to calendar and meeting systems, track meeting outcomes
**Result**: "73% of your meetings schedule follow-up meetings instead of making decisions"

### **Question 3: "Making decisions without external experts?"**
**Old Way**: Ask if they hire consultants
**Workflow Way**: Connect to expense and vendor systems, track consultant spending
**Result**: "You spend $47,000/month on external consultants, up 340% from last year"

### **Question 4: "Did your last initiative make money?"**
**Old Way**: Ask for their guess
**Workflow Way**: Connect to financial systems, track revenue impact
**Result**: "Your last 5 initiatives cost $2.3M but generated only $400K in revenue"

**And so on for all 12 questions...**

## ‚öîÔ∏è **IMAGINATION G WEAPONS + WORKFLOW TRACKING**

IMAGINATION G has 5 "weapons" (solutions) to fix drift. Workflows track if they're working:

### **Weapon: "30-Day Drift Break"**
**What it is**: A 30-day program to get companies moving faster
**Old tracking**: Monthly check-in calls to ask "how's it going?"
**Workflow tracking**: 
- Daily automated progress reports
- Real-time velocity measurements  
- Automatic alerts if momentum slows
- Evidence-based success metrics

### **Weapon: "The Naming"**
**What it is**: Force companies to be crystal clear about their vision
**Old tracking**: Subjective feedback from employees
**Workflow tracking**:
- Communication clarity analysis through messaging systems
- Decision implementation speed tracking
- Vision alignment measurement across teams

## üîç **REAL EXAMPLE: THE MEETING WORKFLOW**

Let's say IMAGINATION G wants to help a client who has too many unproductive meetings.

### **The Problem**: 
Client says "Our meetings are fine" but productivity is low.

### **The Workflow Solution**:
1. **Connect to their calendar system** (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
2. **Automatically track**:
   - How many meetings happen per day
   - How long each meeting lasts
   - How many people attend
   - What happens after each meeting
3. **Measure outcomes**:
   - Do meetings result in decisions?
   - Do meetings result in more meetings?
   - Do meetings result in completed tasks?

### **The Scientific Result**:
"Your team has 47 meetings per week averaging 52 minutes each. Only 12% of meetings result in a clear decision. 78% of meetings schedule follow-up meetings. Your meeting-to-decision ratio is 8:1 (industry best practice is 2:1)."

### **The Business Impact**:
- **Client can't argue with data** - it's their own systems providing the proof
- **IMAGINATION G provides scientific evidence** instead of opinions
- **Improvements can be measured precisely** - "We reduced your meeting-to-decision ratio from 8:1 to 2:1 in 30 days"

## ü§ñ **WHAT ARE JENTIC & OAK RUNNER?**

Think of them as **workflow tools that IMAGINATION G uses**:

### **Jentic = The Workflow Library**
- Like a **massive cookbook** with thousands of business "recipes"
- Instead of food recipes, it has workflows for business tasks
- Example workflows: "How to track meeting efficiency", "How to measure decision speed", "How to monitor revenue impact"

### **Oak Runner = The Recipe Tester**
- Like a **test kitchen** where you try recipes before serving them to guests
- IMAGINATION G can test workflows safely before using them with real clients
- Makes sure workflows work perfectly before deployment

### **Together They Mean**:
IMAGINATION G can find proven business workflows, test them safely, and then deploy them to automate client assessment and tracking.

## üí° **WHY THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY**

### **Traditional Consulting** (like McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte):
1. Send consultants to observe and interview
2. Consultants form opinions based on limited interactions
3. Create PowerPoint presentations with recommendations
4. Charge millions for subjective advice
5. Leave without proving if advice worked

### **IMAGINATION G with Workflows**:
1. Connect directly to client's business systems
2. Automatically collect comprehensive data
3. Provide scientific measurements and evidence
4. Track real-time improvement with precision
5. Prove exact ROI and business impact

**Result**: IMAGINATION G provides **scientific business transformation** instead of **expensive opinions**.

**Q: How is this different from other business software?**
A: This specifically automates IMAGINATION G's unique business transformation methodology.
