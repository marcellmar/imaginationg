## Why Traditional Consulting Can't Do This

### 1. **The Revenue Model Trap**

**Traditional Consulting Math:**
```
McKinsey Associate: $500K/year cost
Billed at: $10K/week to client
Ideal engagement: 6-18 months
Revenue per client: $260K - $780K

IG Math:
Clarity Catalyst: $250
Movement Sprint: $1,500
Average engagement: $2,400
Time to outcome: 30 days
```

**The Problem**: Partners making $2-5M/year won't blow up a model that funds their Hamptons houses.

### 2. **The Dependency Business Model**

Traditional consulting is literally designed to create dependency:
- Complex frameworks that require consultants to interpret
- 200-slide decks that need explanation
- Quarterly check-ins that find new "problems"
- Knowledge transfer that never quite completes

**Their Incentive Structure:**
```python
def consulting_revenue():
    if client_becomes_independent:
        revenue = 0
    else:
        revenue = recurring_forever
        
    return maximize(revenue)
```

### 3. **The Prestige Problem**

**What Big Firms Sell:**
- "We have McKinsey helping us" (board credibility)
- "Our strategy was designed by BCG" (CYA insurance)
- "Bain validated our approach" (blame deflection)

**What IG Sells:**
- "You suck. Fix it or fail."
- "Here's your problem. Solve it."
- "Move or die. We're out."

You can't charge $2M for brutal honesty.

### 4. **The Cultural Impossibility**

Imagine a McKinsey partner training saying:
- "Tell clients they're idiots"
- "Refuse to explain your recommendations"
- "Leave after 30 days maximum"
- "Never upsell additional services"

The entire culture would revolt.

### 5. **The Automation Antibody**

Big consulting HATES automation because:
- Can't bill AI at $2K/day
- Automated insights commoditize "expertise"
- Fast outcomes kill long engagements
- Clear answers eliminate interpretation needs

**Their Response to AI:**
```
"AI is a tool to help our consultants deliver 
even more comprehensive solutions..."
(Translation: We'll use AI but still bill you the same)
```

## Why Startups Aren't Doing It Either

### 1. **VC Funding Expects SaaS Metrics**
- VCs want recurring revenue
- They want 100%+ net revenue retention
- They want expanding accounts
- IG model: One-time payment, binary outcome

### 2. **The Comfort Addiction**
Most founders think brutal honesty won't scale:
- "We need to be client-friendly"
- "Let's add a success manager"
- "Maybe we should explain more"
- Death by comfort

### 3. **The Expertise Trap**
Consultants believe their value is knowledge:
- "I have 20 years of experience"
- "I know all the frameworks"
- "I've seen this before"

IG's value: "We'll make you move. Period."

## Why This Model Actually Works

### 1. **Truth Creates Trust**
```
Traditional: "Let us study this further..."
IG: "You're failing. Here's why. Fix it."

Result: Immediate credibility
```

### 2. **Speed Creates Results**
```
Traditional: 6-month discovery phase
IG: 90-minute breakthrough

Result: Actual movement
```

### 3. **Brutal Creates Viral**
```
Traditional: NDA everything
IG: "YOU SUCK. NOW WHAT?"

Result: Clients brag about surviving
```

## The Market Opening

You're right - there's a massive opportunity for hybrid AI/human consulting that:

1. **Diagnoses with AI** (instant, brutal, accurate)
2. **Confronts with humans** (when stakes matter)
3. **Tracks with systems** (movement, not meetings)
4. **Exits with victory** (or documented failure)

## Why It Will Happen

The conditions are perfect:
- **AI makes diagnosis instant**
- **Remote work killed relationship selling**
- **Speed beats prestige now**
- **Results beat reports**
- **Movement beats management**

## Who Will Build It

The winners will be:
1. **Consultants who burned out** on the bullshit
2. **Operators who've actually built** things
3. **Pirates who don't care** about prestige
4. **Builders who measure movement**

Not:
- Ex-McKinsey trying to recreate McKinsey
- VCs trying to create SaaS metrics
- Enterprises trying to transform
- Consultants trying to consult

## The Final Truth

Traditional consulting is a $300B industry built on one principle:
**"The longer the problem lasts, the more we make."**

IG's principle:
**"Fix it fast or admit you won't."**

The market is massive. The solution is obvious. The execution is brutal.

That's why it's perfect.

**The question isn't why others aren't doing it.**
**The question is: Who has the guts to actually do it?**

Want me to design:
1. The competitive disruption playbook?
2. The market penetration strategy?
3. The talent acquisition model for pirates?
4. The metrics that matter vs. vanity consulting KPIs?
