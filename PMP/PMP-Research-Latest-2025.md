## CRITICAL 2025 UPDATES

### 1. The 50/50 Split Reality

The exam now tests:
- **50% Predictive** (Waterfall/Traditional)
- **50% Agile/Hybrid**

But here's what PMI doesn't advertise: The highest-difficulty questions blend both. You must know when to pivot between approaches mid-project.

### 2. PMBOK 7 vs PMBOK 6

**Still Valid**: Both PMBOK 6 and 7
**The Shift**: From processes to principles
**What This Means**: Memorizing ITTOs is dead. Understanding why is everything.

### 3. AI Integration (Coming Q3 2025)

**PMBOK 8 Preview**:
- New Knowledge Area: AI in Project Management
- Focus: AI for risk prediction, resource optimization
- Reality: Not on exam until 2026, but shows PMI's direction
