# PMP STUDY GUIDE: THE IG METHOD

## STOP STUDYING. START PASSING.

You don't need another 500-page guide. You need to pass the damn test. This guide strips PMP to its bones using IMAGINATION G's confrontational approach. No fluff. No comfort. Just what moves the needle.

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH ABOUT PMP

### What PMP Really Tests
1. **42% People** - Can you handle humans without HR?
2. **50% Process** - Can you pick the right tool without a manual?
3. **8% Business** - Do you understand why projects exist?

### What You Think It Tests
- Memorizing PMBOK formulas ❌
- Reciting process groups ❌
- Framework theater ❌

**Reality:** PMP tests if you can think, not memorize.

## THE IG STUDY METHOD: BINARY LEARNING

### Rule 1: Learn By Deciding, Not Reading

Every concept = Binary choice:
- **Waterfall vs Agile?** When control matters vs when speed matters
- **Push vs Pull?** Command vs Influence
- **Plan vs Adapt?** Predictable vs Chaos

### Rule 2: The 3-Hour Truth

You have 230 minutes. 180 questions. That's 76 seconds per question.
- No time for analysis paralysis
- No time for framework recall
- Only time for gut + knowledge

**IG Training:** Set timer. 60 seconds. Make decision. Move.

## DOMAIN 1: PEOPLE (42%)

### The Only Leadership Formula That Matters

**Traditional PMP:** "Situational leadership adapts style to team maturity..."
**IG Version:** Read the room. Act accordingly. Don't be a robot.

### Conflict Resolution: The Binary

**They teach:** Thomas-Kilmann conflict modes (competing, collaborating, compromising...)
**You need:** 
- Is this conflict productive? → Let it burn
- Is this conflict destructive? → Kill it now

### Virtual Teams: The Reality

**PMBOK says:** "Establish communication protocols and cultural sensitivity..."
**IG says:** Cameras on or get out. Async for work, sync for decisions.

### Key People Concepts (IG Style)

1. **Emotional Intelligence**
   - Stop: Managing emotions
   - Start: Using emotions as data

2. **Team Development** 
   - Forming: They're faking it
   - Storming: Finally being real
   - Norming: Finding their level
   - Performing: Or not. Binary.

3. **Motivation**
   - Maslow is dead
   - People want: Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose
   - Give it or lose them

---

## DOMAIN 2: PROCESS (50%)

### The Methodology Decision Tree

```
Is the outcome clear?
├─ YES → Is it stable?
│   ├─ YES → Waterfall
│   └─ NO → Iterative
└─ NO → Is failure cheap?
    ├─ YES → Agile
    └─ NO → Hybrid
```

### Schedule Management: The Truth

**They want you to memorize:**
- Critical Path Method
- PERT calculations
- Monte Carlo simulations

**What actually matters:**
- What's the real deadline?
- What can actually move?
- Where's the hidden slack?

### Risk: Binary Classification

Stop categorizing risks into 47 types. There are only two:
1. **Risks that kill the project** → Address now
2. **Everything else** → Monitor and move

### Change Management: The IG Way

**Traditional:** Change Control Board, impact analysis, approval matrices...
**Reality:** 
- Will this change deliver more value? → Do it
- Will this change delay value? → Don't
- Document later

### Budget Truth

Forget Earned Value Management formulas. Know this:
- **SPI < 1** = You're behind
- **CPI < 1** = You're over budget
- **Both < 1** = You're fired

---

## DOMAIN 3: BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT (8%)

### The Only Business Acumen You Need

Projects exist to:
1. Make money
2. Save money
3. Meet compliance
4. Enable 1 or 2

If your project doesn't clearly do one of these, it shouldn't exist.

### Benefits Realization

**PMBOK:** "Establish benefits realization management plan..."
**Reality:** Did we get what we paid for? Yes/No.

### Stakeholder Management

Forget power/interest grids. There are three types:
1. **Champions** - Use them
2. **Blockers** - Convert or bypass
3. **Noise** - Ignore

---

## AGILE VS PREDICTIVE: THE REAL DIFFERENCE

### When to Use What

**Predictive (Waterfall):**
- Building a bridge
- Regulatory projects
- When failure = death

**Agile:**
- Software that won't kill anyone
- When learning > planning
- When change is the only constant

**Hybrid:**
- When politics demand waterfall but reality demands agile
- Most real projects

### Agile Concepts That Matter

1. **Scrum Events**
   - Sprint Planning: What can we actually do?
   - Daily Standup: What's blocking you?
   - Sprint Review: Did it work?
   - Retrospective: How do we suck less?

2. **Kanban**
   - Visualize work
   - Limit WIP
   - Manage flow
   - Stop starting, start finishing

3. **Value Delivery**
   - Working software > comprehensive documentation
   - But also: working anything > planning anything

## EXAM STRATEGY: THE IG APPROACH

### Pre-Exam: 48 Hours Before

1. **Stop studying details** - Your brain is full
2. **Review this guide** - One page summaries only
3. **Sleep** - Exhaustion = failure
4. **Trust your preparation** - Or don't take the exam

### During Exam: The 230-Minute War

**Minutes 0-60:** Attack. You're fresh. Crush the easy ones.
**Minutes 61-120:** Steady. Take first break at 60.
**Minutes 121-180:** Survive. Take second break at 120.
**Minutes 181-230:** Sprint. Review flagged. Guess the rest.

### Question Strategy

1. **Read the last sentence first** - That's the real question
2. **Eliminate obviously wrong** - Usually 2 are garbage
3. **Choose the PMI way** - Not the real way
4. **When in doubt** - Pick the most process-heavy answer

### The PMI Mindset Decoder

PMI loves:
- Planning before doing
- Talking to stakeholders
- Following process
- Document everything
- Servant leadership
- Team empowerment

PMI hates:
- Cowboy decisions
- Skipping steps
- Going alone
- Verbal agreements
- Command and control

## FINAL WORDS

You're not studying to become a project management philosopher. You're studying to pass a test that proves you can think in PMI language for 230 minutes.

The PMP is not about being right. It's about being PMI-right.

Stop preparing. Start executing.

The test is just another project. And projects end.

**Now go pass the damn thing.**

*Remember: This guide follows the IG method - confrontation over comfort. If you want gentle encouragement and comprehensive coverage, buy Rita's book. If you want to pass efficiently and move on with your life, you're in the right place.*
