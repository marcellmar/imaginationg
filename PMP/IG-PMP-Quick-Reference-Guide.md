## ONE PAGE TO RULE THEM ALL

This is your exam-day brain. Everything else is noise.

## PMBOK 7: THE 8 PERFORMANCE DOMAINS

### 1. STAKEHOLDERS (Kill or Convert)
**PMI Way**: Engage continuously, understand needs, manage expectations
**IG Translation**: Identify blockers, convert them or route around
**Exam Focus**: 
- Stakeholder register = Know who matters
- Engagement assessment = Who's with/against you
- Always answer: "Engage stakeholder to understand concerns"

### 2. TEAM (Build or Burn)
**PMI Way**: Servant leadership, empower teams, remove obstacles
**IG Translation**: Get the right people or get new people
**Exam Focus**:
- Tuckman: Forming→Storming→Norming→Performing (or not)
- Virtual teams need MORE communication, not less
- Conflict = Opportunity (in PMI land)

### 3. DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (Pick Your Weapon)
```
Is it clear? → Is it stable? → Waterfall
Is it clear? → Is it changing? → Iterative  
Not clear? → Need fast feedback? → Agile
Not clear? → High risk? → Hybrid
```

### 4. PLANNING (Just Enough)
**PMI Way**: Progressive elaboration, rolling wave, adapt as needed
**IG Translation**: Plan enough to start, adjust when reality hits
**Key**: Agile plans too! (Just differently)

### 5. PROJECT WORK (Ship or Die)
**PMI Way**: Manage work, resources, and procurement
**IG Translation**: Get stuff done or explain why not
**Remember**: Knowledge work ≠ Physical work management

### 6. DELIVERY (Value or Vanity)
**PMI Way**: Requirements, scope, quality, deliverables
**IG Translation**: Does it work? Does customer want it? Ship it.
**Critical**: Value ≠ Deliverables

### 7. MEASUREMENT (Numbers Don't Lie)
**PMI Way**: Metrics, KPIs, forecasting
**IG Translation**: Measure what moves, ignore the rest
**Exam**: EVM still shows up, know basics

### 8. UNCERTAINTY (Embrace the Chaos)
**PMI Way**: Risk management, complexity, ambiguity, volatility
**IG Translation**: What can kill us? Fix that. Ignore the rest.

## PMBOK 7: THE 12 PRINCIPLES (SPEED VERSION)

1. **Be a diligent steward** - Don't waste resources
2. **Create collaborative environment** - Teams > Heroes  
3. **Engage stakeholders** - Talk to people who matter
4. **Focus on value** - Outcomes > Outputs
5. **Recognize systems** - Everything connects
6. **Demonstrate leadership** - Lead from where you are
7. **Tailor to context** - One size fits none
8. **Build quality in** - Prevention > Inspection
9. **Navigate complexity** - Simple when possible
10. **Optimize risk** - Risk = Opportunity too
11. **Embrace adaptability** - Change is certain
12. **Enable change** - Make it stick

**Exam Hack**: When stuck, pick the answer that honors most principles

## AGILE FRAMEWORK CHEAT SHEET

### SCRUM (The Popular Kid)
**Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team
**Events**: Sprint Planning→Daily Scrum→Sprint Review→Retrospective  
**Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
**Time**: 2-4 week sprints
**When**: Clear product vision, stable team

### KANBAN (The Flow Master)
**Core**: Visualize work, limit WIP, manage flow
**No timeboxes**: Continuous flow
**Metrics**: Lead time, cycle time, throughput
**When**: Operational work, varying priorities

### XP (The Technical One)
**Practices**: Pair programming, TDD, continuous integration
**Values**: Simplicity, feedback, courage, respect
**When**: High technical risk, quality critical

### LEAN (The Efficiency Expert)
**Focus**: Eliminate waste (muda, mura, muri)
**Tools**: Value stream mapping, 5 whys
**When**: Process improvement, efficiency gains

---

## CRITICAL FORMULAS (THE ONLY ONES THAT MATTER)

### Schedule
**PERT**: (O + 4M + P) / 6
**Std Dev**: (P - O) / 6
**Range**: PERT ± Std Dev

### Cost/Schedule Performance
**SV** = EV - PV (negative = behind)
**CV** = EV - AC (negative = over budget)
**SPI** = EV/PV (<1 = behind)
**CPI** = EV/AC (<1 = over budget)

### Forecasting
**EAC** = BAC/CPI (if current performance continues)
**ETC** = EAC - AC (how much more)
**VAC** = BAC - EAC (variance at completion)

### Other
**Channels** = n(n-1)/2
**Float** = LS - ES or LF - EF

**Exam Reality**: Know concepts > memorize formulas

---

## PMI DECISION PATTERNS

### When You See → Pick This

**"Stakeholder is resistant..."** → Engage and understand
**"Team member conflict..."** → Address directly, seek win-win
**"Scope change requested..."** → Assess impact first
**"Behind schedule..."** → Crash if critical path, fast track if possible
**"Quality issue found..."** → Stop and fix, prevention first
**"Risk identified..."** → Analyze then response plan
**"Team is distributed..."** → More communication tools
**"Customer unhappy..."** → Understand requirements gap
**"Resource conflict..."** → Negotiate, escalate if needed
**"Change in regulations..."** → Impact analysis, update plan

---

## RISK RESPONSES (MEMORIZE THIS)

### Negative Risks (Threats)
1. **Avoid** - Change plan to eliminate
2. **Transfer** - Insurance, outsource  
3. **Mitigate** - Reduce probability/impact
4. **Accept** - Do nothing (active/passive)

### Positive Risks (Opportunities)
1. **Exploit** - Make it happen
2. **Share** - Partner for benefit
3. **Enhance** - Increase probability/impact
4. **Accept** - Hope it happens

**New**: ESCALATE - When outside your authority

---

## VIRTUAL TEAM ESSENTIALS

- **Communication Plan** = Lifeline (who, what, when, how)
- **Time zones** = Respect them, rotate meetings
- **Cultural differences** = Asset not obstacle
- **Tools** > Face time (but video when possible)
- **Trust** = Harder to build, easier to break
- **Documentation** = More important than co-located

---

## CHANGE CONTROL SIMPLIFIED

### Predictive
1. Change requested
2. Impact analyzed  
3. CCB reviews
4. Approve/reject
5. Update everything
6. Communicate

### Agile
1. Change requested
2. Product Owner prioritizes
3. Goes in backlog
4. Team pulls when ready
5. No ceremony needed

---

## THE PMI MINDSET DECODER

### PMI Always Prefers:
- Plan before act
- Collaborate over command
- Prevent over correct
- Document over verbal
- Process over heroics
- Team over individual

### PMI Never Likes:
- Skip steps
- Go alone
- Hide problems
- Blame people
- Cut quality
- Ignore stakeholders

## EXAM DAY BRAIN DUMP

First 10 minutes, write down:
1. EVM formulas
2. Risk responses  
3. Process groups (if you must)
4. Anything you're worried about forgetting

Then forget it all and think.

---

## SCENARIO PATTERN RECOGNITION

**"First thing to do?"** = Understand/analyze/assess
**"Best thing to do?"** = PMI-preferred approach
**"Next thing to do?"** = Follow the process
**"Should have done?"** = Prevented earlier

---

## THE FINAL ALGORITHM

When completely stuck:
1. Eliminate obviously wrong (usually 2)
2. Pick the most collaborative
3. Pick the most process-heavy
4. When tie, pick longer answer
5. Never change unless certain

---

## IG EXAM MANTRAS

- "What would PMI do?" (not real life)
- "Process over speed" (for exam only)
- "When in doubt, communicate"
- "Value over deliverables"
- "Prevent over fix"

---

**This guide + your brain = PASS**

Stop reading. Start doing.

The exam isn't testing if you're a good PM.
It's testing if you can think like PMI for 230 minutes.

You can.
