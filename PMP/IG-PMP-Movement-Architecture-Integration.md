# IG/PMP INTEGRATION: MOVEMENT ARCHITECTURE FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT

## THE COLLISION OF TWO WORLDS

PMP teaches you to manage projects. IG teaches you to force movement. This document bridges both - creating a framework for project managers who refuse to let projects drift.

---

## CORE CONCEPT: DRIFT VS MOVEMENT IN PROJECTS

### Traditional PM Problem
- Projects start with energy
- Momentum fades by month 3
- Teams go through motions
- Deliverables happen but value doesn't
- Everyone pretends it's fine

### The IG Diagnosis
**Your project isn't failing. It's drifting.**

Drift indicators in projects:
- Status meetings where nothing changes
- "On track" when everyone knows it's not
- Stakeholders who've stopped caring
- Team members who've stopped trying
- PMO theater replacing actual progress

## THE MOVEMENT ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK FOR PMs

### Traditional PMBOK Phases vs Movement Architecture

| PMBOK Phase | Traditional Approach | Movement Architecture |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Initiation | Charter, stakeholder analysis | **Collision Setup**: Force brutal clarity on WHY |
| Planning | WBS, schedules, budgets | **Binary Roadmap**: What moves vs what doesn't |
| Execution | Manage work, manage team | **Daily Collisions**: Force decisions, not discussions |
| Monitoring | Track variances, report status | **Drift Detection**: Call BS immediately |
| Closing | Lessons learned, documentation | **Exit Velocity**: What momentum continues? |

---

## PRINCIPLE 1: BINARY PROJECT DECISIONS

### Stop Managing, Start Forcing

Traditional PM: "Let's discuss options in the steering committee..."
Movement PM: "We do A or B. Choose now. Meeting over."

### The Binary Decision Framework

Every project decision must be framed as:
- Ship or kill
- Add scope or cut scope  
- Move deadline or cut features
- Add resources or reduce quality
- Go or no-go

**No middle ground. No "let's see." No delays.**

### Implementation in PM Tools

**In your project charter:**
Instead of: "The project aims to improve customer satisfaction through enhanced digital capabilities..."
Write: "We either become digital-first by Q3 or we admit we're a legacy company. Pick one."

**In status reports:**
Instead of: "Project is 73% complete with some risks..."
Write: "We ship June 1st or we don't. Currently: Won't. Fix needed: Kill features X, Y."

---

## PRINCIPLE 2: THE DAILY COLLISION

### Replace Daily Standups with Daily Confrontations

**Traditional Standup:**
- What I did yesterday
- What I'll do today  
- Blockers

**Movement Collision:**
- What I shipped yesterday (not did, SHIPPED)
- What I'll ship today (specific, measurable)
- What's the ONE thing stopping me (name names)

### The 5-Minute Collision Format

1. **60 seconds**: Biggest movement yesterday
2. **60 seconds**: Biggest planned movement today
3. **60 seconds**: The friction point
4. **120 seconds**: Solve the friction or escalate
5. **0 seconds**: No discussion. Execute.

---

## PRINCIPLE 3: STAKEHOLDER COLLISION MANAGEMENT

### Traditional Stakeholder Matrix vs Movement Matrix

Forget Power/Interest grids. Use the Movement Matrix:

| Stakeholder Type | Traditional Approach | Movement Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Blockers** | Manage carefully | Confront immediately |
| **Drifters** | Regular updates | Force binary choice |
| **Champions** | Keep informed | Deploy as weapons |
| **Ghosts** | Try to engage | Cut them loose |

### The Stakeholder Collision Protocol

1. **Identify the drift enablers** - Who benefits from delay?
2. **Force the conversation** - "You're blocking. Why?"
3. **Binary ultimatum** - "Support actively or get out"
4. **Document the choice** - They own their decision
5. **Move without them** - If they chose out

---

## PRINCIPLE 4: RISK AS MOVEMENT CATALYST

### Traditional Risk Management vs Movement Risk

**Traditional:** Identify → Analyze → Plan Response → Monitor
**Movement:** Identify → Confront → Use or Kill → Move

### The Movement Risk Categories

1. **Velocity Risks** - Will this slow us down?
   - If yes: Kill it now
   - If no: Ignore it

2. **Drift Risks** - Will this enable stagnation?
   - If yes: Address immediately
   - If no: Monitor weekly

3. **Collision Risks** - Will this force a decision?
   - If yes: Accelerate it
   - If no: Create it

### Risk Collision Meeting Format

Weekly, 30 minutes max:
- Minutes 0-10: What will stop movement this week?
- Minutes 10-20: Binary solutions for each
- Minutes 20-30: Assign ownership and deadlines
- No risk registers. Just decisions.

---

## PRINCIPLE 5: VELOCITY METRICS OVER VANITY METRICS

### Stop Measuring Activity, Start Measuring Movement

**Vanity Metrics (Traditional PM):**
- % Complete
- Budget variance
- Schedule variance
- Resource utilization
- Stakeholder satisfaction

**Velocity Metrics (Movement PM):**
- Decisions made per week
- Features shipped per sprint
- Blockers killed per day
- Days since last pivot
- Revenue/value delivered to date

### The Movement Dashboard

Create ONE dashboard that shows:
1. **Movement Velocity**: Are we faster than last week?
2. **Drift Indicator**: Days since last major decision
3. **Collision Count**: Confrontations forced this week
4. **Value Delivered**: Actual business impact, not %
5. **Exit Proximity**: How close to done? (Binary: Close or Not)

---

## PRINCIPLE 6: THE SPRINT COLLISION

### Agile Sprints vs Movement Sprints

Traditional Agile focuses on sustainable pace. Movement focuses on unsustainable bursts.

**The 30-Day Movement Sprint Protocol:**
- Day 1-5: Collision planning (what's the biggest impact?)
- Day 6-25: Execution fury (ship daily or explain why)
- Day 26-29: Polish only what's customer-facing
- Day 30: Ship and celebrate, or admit failure

### Sprint Collision Rules

1. **No rollover** - Unfinished work dies
2. **No extending** - 30 days means 30 days
3. **No perfection** - Ship ugly but functional
4. **No committees** - One person decides
5. **No excuses** - Results or reasons, pick one

## INTEGRATION TACTICS: PMP MEETS IG

### For the PMP Exam

When you see: "Stakeholder is resistant to change..."
Think: "Confront the resistance immediately"
But answer: "Engage stakeholder to understand concerns"

When you see: "Project is experiencing scope creep..."
Think: "Binary decision - original scope or new scope"
But answer: "Implement change control process"

**Remember: Pass the test PMI's way, run projects IG's way.**

### For Real Projects

1. **Use PMP processes as scaffolding** - They're not wrong, just slow
2. **Inject movement principles** - Every process needs a collision point
3. **Document in PMI language** - CYA still matters
4. **Execute in IG style** - Movement over methodology

---

## THE MOVEMENT PM MANIFESTO

1. **Decisions over discussions**
2. **Shipping over planning**
3. **Confrontation over consensus**
4. **Movement over methodology**
5. **Results over reports**

---

## PRACTICAL TEMPLATES

### 1. The Movement Charter (1 Page Max)

```
PROJECT: [Name]
BINARY GOAL: We either [specific outcome] by [date] or we [consequence]
MOVEMENT OWNER: [One name, not a committee]
COLLISION POINTS: [3-5 forced decision dates]
SUCCESS METRIC: [One number that matters]
FAILURE PROTOCOL: [What happens if we drift]
```

### 2. The Daily Collision Report

```
DATE: [Today]
SHIPPED YESTERDAY: [Specific deliverable or "NOTHING - fixing today"]
SHIPPING TODAY: [Specific deliverable with time]
BLOCKING ISSUE: [One thing, one owner]
RESOLUTION: [Binary decision made]
TOMORROW'S COLLISION: [What gets confronted next]
```

### 3. The Stakeholder Collision Matrix

```
NAME | TYPE (Blocker/Champion/Ghost/Drifter) | LAST COLLISION | NEXT MOVE
-----|--------------------------------------|----------------|------------
John | Blocker | Called out in steering meeting | Remove from approvals
Sara | Champion | Deployed to convince Finance | Give more authority
PMO | Drifter | Forced to pick methodology | Monitor weekly
```

## CASE STUDY: ERP IMPLEMENTATION

### Traditional Approach (Failed)
- 18-month timeline
- 47 stakeholders consulted
- 300-page requirements
- Monthly steering committees
- Result: 3 years, 3x budget, half scope

### Movement Approach (Succeeded)
- 90-day sprints
- 5 decision makers
- 10-page binary choices document
- Weekly collision meetings
- Result: 9 months, on budget, full scope

**The Difference:**
Every week, someone was forced to decide something. No drift allowed.

## FINAL INTEGRATION

You're not choosing between PMP and IG. You're using PMP's structure to enable IG's movement. 

**PMP gives you the map. IG gives you the velocity.**

Together, they create projects that don't just complete - they collide with success.

Remember:
- Use PMP to get into the room
- Use IG to own the room
- Use both to move the project

The best project managers know all the rules. The best leaders know when to break them for movement.

*This integration framework is for PMs who are tired of managing drift and ready to force movement. Use PMP to pass the test. Use IG to pass the real test - shipping value.*
