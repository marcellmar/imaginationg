## FINAL WORDS

This checklist is your collision course with PMP success. Every checkbox is a small victory. Every week completed is momentum gained.

You don't need to be perfect. You need to be consistent.

You don't need to know everything. You need to know enough.

You don't need confidence. You need commitment.

**Check the boxes. Take the test. Get the cert. Move on.**

The PMP is just another project. And projects end.
