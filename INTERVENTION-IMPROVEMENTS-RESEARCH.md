# INTERVENTION IMPROVEMENTS: REAL-WORLD RESEARCH & RECOMMENDATIONS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on extensive research into what actually works in consulting and business interventions vs. traditional approaches, this document provides specific recommendations to enhance our five interventions. The research reveals significant gaps between what consultants claim and what clients actually need, presenting opportunities to differentiate through authentic value delivery.

## KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS

### What Clients Actually Want vs. What They Get

**CLIENTS WANT:**
- **Reliability** - "Do what you say when you say it" (ranked #1 priority)
- **Truth-telling** - Someone to "speak truth to power" 
- **Real implementation support** - Not just reports and recommendations
- **Personalized service** - Solutions tailored to unique context

**WHAT THEY TYPICALLY GET:**
- Generic template-based solutions
- Expensive reports that gather dust
- Consultants who "prepare reports and leave"
- Academic theories over practical solutions

### Critical Success Factors from Research

1. **Speed Over Perfection** - Top-quartile companies capture 74% of transformation value within first 12 months
2. **Collaborative Partnership** - "Let's Do It Together" relationships work better than expert-client dynamics
3. **Financial Discipline** - Well-thought-out financial impact milestones at each stage
4. **Employee Engagement** - Without buy-in, change management fails
5. **Anti-Template Approach** - "No two clients want the same thing"

## CONTRARIAN INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH

### What Most Consultants Do Wrong
1. **Template Thinking** - Copy what other companies do vs. solve specific problems
2. **Analysis Paralysis** - Months of discovery before any action
3. **Expert Arrogance** - Working independently vs. collaboratively
4. **Activity Metrics** - Measuring engagement duration vs. business outcomes

### What Actually Works
1. **Speed + Iteration** - Quick diagnosis, immediate action, course correction
2. **Collaborative Partnership** - Client as co-creator, not passive recipient
3. **Financial Focus** - ROI milestones at every stage
4. **Implementation Support** - Helping with execution, not just recommendations

### The IG Advantage
Our current interventions already avoid most consulting failures:
- ✅ Fast delivery vs. lengthy discovery
- ✅ Clear outcomes vs. vague improvements  
- ✅ Action-oriented vs. analysis-heavy
- ✅ Direct communication vs. consultant-speak

**Enhancement opportunities** focus on collaboration, risk mitigation, and outcome measurement while maintaining our core differentiators.

---

## CONCLUSION

The research reveals that our intervention structure is fundamentally sound but can be enhanced with:

1. **More collaborative engagement** (vs. expert delivery)
2. **Clearer risk mitigation** (guarantees and course correction)
3. **Better success measurement** (business outcomes vs. deliverables)
4. **Supportive implementation** (momentum maintenance vs. handoff)

These improvements maintain our "no BS" positioning while addressing real client needs that traditional consultants miss. The goal is evolution, not revolution - keeping what differentiates us while adding what actually works.
