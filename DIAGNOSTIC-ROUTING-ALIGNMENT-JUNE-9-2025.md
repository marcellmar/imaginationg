# DIAGNOSTIC ROUTING ALIGNMENT
**Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Session:** Diagnostic Logic Overhaul & Professional Intervention Routing

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
There was a fundamental disconnect between diagnostic questions and intervention routing:
- **Start page**: Routed to 5 specific paid interventions that didn't exist as pages
- **Diagnostic page**: Routed to DIY tools instead of professional interventions  
- **Assessment logic**: Didn't align with available solutions
- **User confusion**: No clear explanation when routing didn't match their problem selection

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. UPDATED PROBLEM TYPES (Start Page)
Completely restructured the 5 problem types to align with actual professional interventions:

**OLD PROBLEM TYPES:**
- My team is stuck
- I don't know what's wrong  
- Should we enter this market?
- We need to ship something

**NEW PROBLEM TYPES:**
- **Truth Crisis** → Routes to **THE NAMING** ($750)
- **Broken Connections** → Routes to **THE MAP** ($1,500)
- **Market Decision** → Routes to **THE MARKET SMACKDOWN** ($2,250)
- **Stuck Patterns** → Routes to **THE OVERRIDE** ($3,000)
- **Need to Ship** → Routes to **THE BUILD** ($4,500)

### 2. ADDED NEW QUESTION SET
Created comprehensive 12-question diagnostic for "Stuck Patterns" problem type:
- **Pattern Recognition** (3 questions)
- **Dysfunction Cycles** (3 questions) 
- **Awareness Level** (2 questions)
- **Systemic Issues** (2 questions)
- **Intervention Readiness** (2 questions)

All marked as `diy: false` to ensure professional intervention routing.

### 3. UPDATED DIAGNOSTIC PAGE ROUTING
Changed all routing from DIY tools to professional interventions:
- **Crisis level** (score < 25%) → THE OVERRIDE
- **Truth issues** → THE NAMING
- **System problems** → THE OVERRIDE  
- **Execution issues** → THE BUILD
- **Decision problems** → THE MARKET SMACKDOWN
- **High performers** → THE MAP

### 4. ADDED CLEAR ROUTING EXPLANATIONS
Implemented specific "WHY THIS INTERVENTION" sections that:
- Reference specific questions that triggered the routing
- Use plain, actionable language
- Explain the cause-and-effect logic
- Handle mismatched expectations clearly

**Example:**
> **WHY THIS INTERVENTION:**  
> Based on your answers about FOUNDER IDENTITY and CONFLICT AVOIDANCE, you're avoiding hard truths or struggling with leadership identity. Until you get brutally honest about what's really happening, any other solution will fail. We need to fix the truth problem first.

### 5. TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
- Added question-specific trigger tracking
- Implemented fallback logic for edge cases
- Updated filter mapping to new intervention categories
- Improved session storage context for better routing
- Added professional intervention pricing display

## FILES MODIFIED

### `/pages/start.tsx`
- Updated all 5 problem types with new IDs, descriptions, and examples
- Added comprehensive "stuck-patterns" question set (12 questions)
- Rewrote routing logic to target professional interventions
- Added specific trigger explanations with question references
- Updated filter detection logic for new intervention categories

### `/pages/diagnostic.tsx`
- Changed all routing from DIY tools to professional interventions
- Updated recommendation language from "PORTAL" to "PROFESSIONAL INTERVENTION"
- Added DIY alternatives as secondary recommendations
- Updated success metrics and intervention descriptions

## CURRENT ROUTING LOGIC

### Problem Type → Intervention Mapping:
1. **Truth Crisis** + identity/truth filters → **THE NAMING**
2. **Broken Connections** + network/relationship filters → **THE MAP**  
3. **Market Decision** + market/decision filters → **THE MARKET SMACKDOWN**
4. **Stuck Patterns** + pattern/energy filters → **THE OVERRIDE**
5. **Need to Ship** + shipping/perfectionism filters → **THE BUILD**

### Cross-Problem Routing:
- Users selecting any problem type can be routed to different interventions based on their answers
- Each mismatch gets a clear explanation of why the diagnostic overrode their selection
- All explanations reference specific questions that triggered the routing

## AVAILABLE PROFESSIONAL INTERVENTIONS
- ✅ **THE NAMING** - Truth excavation ($750)
- ✅ **THE MAP** - Network rebuilding ($1,500)
- ✅ **THE MARKET SMACKDOWN** - Market decisions ($2,250)  
- ✅ **THE OVERRIDE** - Pattern breaking ($3,000)
- ✅ **THE BUILD** - MVP shipping ($4,500)

## RESULTS ACHIEVED
- **Consistent routing**: All diagnostics now route to professional interventions
- **Clear explanations**: Users understand why they're getting specific recommendations
- **Question-specific logic**: Routing explanations reference actual answers
- **Professional positioning**: DIY tools positioned as alternatives, not primary recommendations
- **Reduced confusion**: Clear cause-and-effect explanations for routing decisions

## NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED
1. **Test routing logic** with real user scenarios
2. **Validate intervention pages** exist and are properly linked
3. **Monitor user feedback** on routing explanations
4. **Consider A/B testing** explanation formats
5. **Add analytics** to track routing patterns and user satisfaction
