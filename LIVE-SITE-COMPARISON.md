# Live Site vs Local Version Comparison

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the live site at www.imaginationg.studio and comparing it to the local codebase, there are significant differences in content, styling, and functionality. The live site appears to be more developed with additional content and features not present in the local version.

## Landing Page (/)

### Live Site:

  - Provocative opening statements ("You're bluffing", "They see it", etc.)
  - "WHO ARE WE FOR?" section with bullet points
  - Single CTA: "[YOU SUCK. NOW WHAT?]" linking to /ig-complete-flow

## Priority Recommendations:

### High Priority (Affects User Experience):
1. **Update /about page** with proper founder story, image, and philosophy
2. **Add Inter font** import for typography consistency
3. **Enhance weapon pages** with detailed descriptions, durations, and "DEPLOY" buttons
4. **Add actual images** to replace placeholders

### Medium Priority (Content Enhancement):
5. Update individual weapon pages with full descriptions
6. Ensure PDF content matches live "5 Signals" version
7. Add any missing hover effects or transitions
8. Verify all booking links work correctly

### Low Priority (Polish):
9. Fine-tune spacing and margins to match live site exactly
10. Add any missing animations or micro-interactions
11. Ensure all email functionality is properly configured
12. Test all interactive features thoroughly

## Overall Status:
The local version has most of the functionality implemented but lacks some content depth and polish compared to the live site. The core user flows work, but the site needs content updates and visual refinements to match the live version completely.
