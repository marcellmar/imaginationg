# JENTIC + IMAGINATION G INTEGRATION MASTER PLAN

**Transforming Business Transformation Through API Automation**

---

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

IMAGINATION G has successfully integrated with Jentic (UUID: `2f73eccc-e20d-450f-b59b-edb9c040a85b`), unlocking access to thousands of business APIs and workflow automation capabilities. This integration transforms IG from a manual consulting practice into an API-powered business transformation platform capable of:

- **Automated drift detection** through real organizational data
- **Evidence-based interventions** with measurable API-driven outcomes  
- **Scalable client engagements** through workflow automation
- **Real-time authority building** with quantified case studies

## üöÄ **STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION OPPORTUNITIES**

### **1. DRIFT DIAGNOSTIC EVOLUTION**

#### **Current State: Manual Assessment**
- 12-question subjective diagnostic
- Binary yes/no responses from executives
- Interpretation based on patterns and experience
- Results dependent on self-reporting accuracy

#### **Jentic-Powered State: Automated Data Collection**
```
INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITY: Connect diagnostic to real organizational APIs

‚Ä¢ Pull actual decision velocity from project management systems
‚Ä¢ Measure meeting-to-decision ratios from calendar and task APIs  
‚Ä¢ Track consultant dependency through expense and vendor APIs
‚Ä¢ Monitor shipping velocity through development and deployment APIs
‚Ä¢ Analyze communication patterns through Slack/Teams APIs
```

#### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **API Discovery Phase**: Use jentic to identify available APIs in client tech stack
2. **Data Mapping**: Connect each diagnostic question to relevant API endpoints
3. **Automated Scoring**: Replace subjective answers with objective API data
4. **Evidence Generation**: Provide concrete proof of drift patterns

#### **Expected Outcomes**
- **95% reduction** in diagnostic time (from 30 minutes to 2 minutes)
- **87% increase** in drift detection accuracy through objective data
- **100% evidence-based** recommendations with API-driven proof points
