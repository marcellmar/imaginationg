üî• ORGANIZATIONAL DRIFT is killing your business momentum.

Most teams are busy but not moving forward. Here's how to diagnose if you're drifting:

‚ùå Endless planning sessions that produce documents, not results
‚ùå Meetings that generate more meetings instead of decisions  
‚ùå "Strategic initiatives" in progress for months with no visible change

The antidote? Movement Architecture.

Learn the brutal truth about what's broken:
