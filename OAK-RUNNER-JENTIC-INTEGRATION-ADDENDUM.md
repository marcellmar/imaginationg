## üìã **ENHANCED WORKFLOW DEVELOPMENT PROCESS**

### **5-Step Development Cycle**

#### **Step 1: Discovery (Jentic)**
```bash
# Discover relevant workflows for client use case
python3 jentic_discovery.py --client-industry "financial-services" \
  --use-case "organizational-drift-detection"
```

#### **Step 2: Download (Jentic)**
```bash
# Download workflow execution files
python3 jentic_download.py --workflow-ids "workflow1,workflow2,workflow3"
```

#### **Step 3: Local Testing (Oak Runner)**
```bash
# Test workflow execution locally
oak-runner execute-workflow workflow-id workflow.arazzo --dry-run
oak-runner show-env-mappings workflow.arazzo
oak-runner generate-example --workflow-id workflow-id workflow.arazzo
```

#### **Step 4: Customization (IMAGINATION G)**
```bash
# Adapt workflow for IMAGINATION G methodology
python3 ig_workflow_adapter.py --workflow workflow.arazzo \
  --adaptation "drift-diagnostic" --output ig_diagnostic_workflow.arazzo
```

#### **Step 5: Client Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy tested workflow to client environment
oak-runner execute-workflow ig_diagnostic_workflow.arazzo \
  --env-file client_env.yaml --output-format json
```

## üéØ **ENHANCED IMAGINATION G APPLICATIONS**

### **1. Drift Diagnostic Automation 2.0**

#### **Current Enhancement with Oak Runner**
```python
class EnhancedDriftDiagnostic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.jentic = jentic.Jentic()
        self.oak_runner = OakRunnerExecutor()
        
    async def run_api_powered_diagnostic(self, client_config):
        # 1. Discover available APIs in client environment
        available_apis = await self.jentic.discover_client_apis(client_config)
        
        # 2. Download relevant workflow templates
        workflows = await self.jentic.download_diagnostic_workflows(available_apis)
        
        # 3. Test workflows locally with Oak Runner
        tested_workflows = []
        for workflow in workflows:
            test_result = self.oak_runner.test_workflow(workflow, dry_run=True)
            if test_result.success:
                tested_workflows.append(workflow)
        
        # 4. Execute validated workflows against client systems
        diagnostic_data = {}
        for workflow in tested_workflows:
            result = self.oak_runner.execute_workflow(workflow, client_config)
            diagnostic_data[workflow.metric] = result.output
        
        # 5. Generate evidence-based drift score
