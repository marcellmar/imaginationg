### The 5-Minute Nexel Audit
**For:** Anyone feeling stuck  
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Setup:** None  
**Pricing:** DIY Free | Guided Setup $500

Ask yourself:

**Setup:** Simple spreadsheet  
**Pricing:** DIY Free | Guided Setup $1,000 | Full Facilitation $3,500

Track daily:
1. **Energy In** - What gave you energy today?
2. **Energy Out** - What drained energy today?
3. **Nexel Alignment** - Were you working with or against your problem-solving style?
4. **Pattern Recognition** - What situations energize vs. drain your specific nexel?

**Result:** Data-driven nexel deployment optimization.

## Micro-Interventions (Under 5 Minutes)
**Pricing:** DIY Free | Micro-coaching $200/session

### The Nexel Question
When stuck, ask: "What would my opposite nexel type do right now?"

### The Block Reframe
Instead of "How do I get around this?" ask "How does this block reveal the real path?"

### The Momentum Check
Before any meeting: "Will this create momentum for my nexel type or drain it?"

### The Energy Protection
Before saying yes: "Does this request align with how I naturally handle problems?"

### The Reality Anchor
When pressured: "What would happen if we let this problem sit for 24 hours?"

## Team Nexel Interventions

### The Nexel Map

**Setup:** Team meeting  
**Pricing:** DIY Free | Guided Setup $1,500 | Full Facilitation $5,000 | Team Training $10,000

1. **Block Inventory** - What's stopping progress organization-wide?
2. **Nexel Assignment** - Who would be energized by each specific block?
3. **Energy Matching** - Match people to blocks that fuel rather than drain them
4. **Cross-Training** - Share techniques across different nexel types

### The Anti-Meeting Meeting
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Setup:** Stand-up style  
**Pricing:** DIY Free | Guided Setup $800 | Full Facilitation $2,500 | Team Training $5,000

4. **Momentum Plans** - How will you deploy your nexel tomorrow?

## Implementation Notes

- **Start Small** - Pick one intervention and try it for a week
- **Match to Nexel** - Use interventions that align with your constraint navigation style
- **Measure Energy** - Track whether interventions create or drain energy
- **Share Results** - Document what works for your specific nexel type
- **Iterate Fast** - Adjust approaches based on what actually creates momentum

## Warning Signs to Stop

- Intervention feels forced or unnatural
- Energy decreases rather than increases  
- You're fighting your nexel to make the intervention work
- Team resistance suggests nexel mismatch
- Results feel superficial rather than systemic

Remember: The best intervention is the one that works with your nexel, not against it.
