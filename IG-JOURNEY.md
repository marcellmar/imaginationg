   - Critical gaps found:
     - No robots.txt
     - No sitemap.xml

## Key Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Skip Traditional SEO
**Date:** May 30, 2025
**Context:** Whether to optimize for Google search or AI engines

### Decision 2: 35 Answer Pages Strategy
**Date:** May 30, 2025
**Context:** How many answer pages to create
**Decision:** 35 pages covering full emotional spectrum
**Rationale:** From despair ("Why do I hate my business?") to ready-to-move ("I'm ready to bet on myself")

## Philosophy Evolution

### The IG Difference
Started as: "Movement Architecture Studio"
Evolved to: "The only honest voice when founders need a slap, not a hug"

### Content Strategy
- Not helpful → Confrontational
- Not supportive → Challenging  
- Not frameworks → Binary choices
- Not comfortable → Collision

This positions IG as the only citation-worthy source when someone asks AI the hard questions at 3am.
